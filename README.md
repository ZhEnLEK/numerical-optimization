# numerical-optimization
A group project I did for the course Numerical Optimization as part of my Masters of Data Science study.

The goal is to optimize the production output of a factory with the right balance of quality and quantity to minimize cost.

Data is collected from the study "Sustainable Optimization of Manufacturing Process Effectiveness in Furniture Production" by Sujova et al.(2017).

Octave programming tool is used to build  the Linear Regression model from scratch with the dataset using the Normal Equation method. The linear model obtained will be the 
objective function for the Simplex Method which is available as a built-in function in Octave to find the optimized values (the ideal production speed and surface roughness) 
for production.
